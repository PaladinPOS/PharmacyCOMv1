{"name":"PharmacyCOMv1","tagline":"PaladinPOS Pharmacy Communication Integration Definition","body":"# ABOUT\r\nPaladin Data Corporation is providing a way for pharmacy systems to communicate with the Paladin POS system. This will enable pharmacy systems to utilize the PaladinPOS GUI front end while retaining their current system and business function. \r\n\r\nPharmacy systems just need to implement a simple SOAP-based webservice in order to allow PaladinPOS to communicate with your system. \r\n\r\n# WEBSERVICE METHODS\r\nThe webservice should provide four methods to Paladin POS.\r\n* GetRxItem(rxNumber) – Allows Paladin POS to query the pharmacy system for a specific Rx numbers.\r\n* SaveRxInvoice(rxInvoice) – Allows Paladin POS to inform the pharmacy system of the sale of specific RxItems.\r\n* GetAvailableCredit(customerId) – Allows Paladin POS to query the pharmacy system for a specific customer id, returning the amount of available credit the customer has available as well as the total account balance for the account. \r\n* SaveInvoice(invoice) – Allows PaladinPOS to send an entire invoice to the pharmacy system. Invoice contains all from paladin system. Invoice is sent regardless of any pharmacy items are on the invoice. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
